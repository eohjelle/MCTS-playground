# ChatGPT overview

For researching reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for playing games, you’ll want to be aware of tools across different areas: environments, frameworks, libraries, debugging tools, and compute resources. Here’s a categorized list of key tools:

1. Environments for RL Research

These provide standardized benchmarks and simulators for testing RL algorithms.
• Gymnasium (formerly OpenAI Gym) – Standardized RL environments.
• PettingZoo – Multi-agent RL environments.
• Procgen – Procedurally generated environments for generalization in RL.
• MuJoCo – Physics-based simulation for continuous control tasks.
• DeepMind Control Suite – Suite of continuous control tasks similar to MuJoCo.
• MineRL – RL research in Minecraft.
• Elo Battle – A framework for RL agents competing in Elo-ranked tournaments.

If you’re specifically working on Dots and Boxes, you might want to implement your own environment using:
• gym.Env – Custom Gym environments.
• pettingzoo.AECEnv – If multi-agent learning is involved.

2. RL Frameworks & Libraries

These provide implementations of RL algorithms and utilities for training agents.
• Stable-Baselines3 – Well-implemented RL algorithms for PyTorch.
• RLlib – Scalable, distributed RL framework from Ray.
• Acme – DeepMind’s modular RL library.
• Tianshou – Efficient RL library with customizable policies.
• CleanRL – Clean, minimal RL implementations.

If you’re working with AlphaZero-like methods:
• Muzero General – Implementation of MuZero.
• ReZero – AlphaZero-like framework for arbitrary games.

3. Model Architectures & Deep Learning Libraries

Since RL often involves deep learning, you’ll likely use one of these:
• PyTorch – Flexible deep learning framework (favored for RL).
• TensorFlow – Popular but less flexible for RL.
• JAX – Highly efficient array-based computation, used in some RL research (e.g., DeepMind’s Haiku).

For implementing transformer-based RL or sequence models:
• Trax – Google’s RL and deep learning library.
• Recurrent Memory Transformers – If experimenting with memory-based agents.

4. RL-Specific Debugging & Analysis Tools
   • Weights & Biases – Experiment tracking, visualization, and hyperparameter tuning.
   • TensorBoard – Logging and visualization of training metrics.
   • RL Games – RL framework with PyTorch and visualization tools.
   • Magent – Large-scale multi-agent RL debugging.
   • TorchRL – PyTorch’s RL debugging utilities.

5. Compute & Distributed Training

For scaling up your RL experiments:
• Ray Tune – Distributed hyperparameter tuning for RL.
• Slurm – Job scheduling on compute clusters.
• TPUs – Useful for large-scale training.
• DeepSpeed – Distributed training library for PyTorch.

6. Game-Specific Tools

For custom board games like Dots and Boxes, you may need:
• Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) frameworks
• MCTS-Bench – Benchmarks MCTS algorithms.
• AlphaZero.jl – Efficient Julia-based AlphaZero.
• Game Simulators
• Pyspiel (OpenSpiel) – RL for board games, including support for AlphaZero-like training.
• Surreal – For complex game environments.

7. Evolutionary & Bandit-Based Approaches

If you’re exploring Thompson Sampling or alternative search-based learning:
• Nevergrad – Evolutionary & derivative-free optimization.
• DEAP – Evolutionary algorithm framework in Python.
• MABWiser – Multi-armed bandit algorithms.

8. Tutorials & Reproducible RL Papers
   • Spinning Up in Deep RL – OpenAI’s beginner-friendly guide.
   • RL Course by David Silver – DeepMind’s reinforcement learning lectures.
   • RL-Zoo3 – Ready-to-use RL implementations.
   • RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback) – If incorporating human-in-the-loop feedback.

Which Should You Focus On?

For Dots and Boxes with an AlphaZero-like approach, I’d recommend: 1. Pyspiel – For board game RL research. 2. Stable-Baselines3 – If you want to experiment with existing RL algorithms first. 3. Muzero General – For training an AlphaZero-like model. 4. Weights & Biases – To track experiments effectively. 5. Ray RLlib – If you need scalable RL experiments.
