# ChatGPT literature review

I'll investigate whether there is existing research or implementations that combine Dirichlet-like outcome distributions with Boltzmann-like policy distributions in reinforcement learning, particularly in AlphaZero-like approaches. This includes both academic papers and other sources, such as blog posts or open-source implementations. I'll let you know what I find.

# Dirichlet-Modeled Outcome Uncertainty in RL

**Distributional Reinforcement Learning (RL):** Recent advances in _distributional RL_ represent value predictions as full distributions rather than point estimates. For example, C51 and related methods approximate the return distribution with a categorical model. A Bayesian extension, **Bayesian Categorical Q-Learning (BCQL)**, maintains a Dirichlet **distribution** over the categorical return probabilities for each state-action pair ([](https://rlj.cs.umass.edu/2024/papers/RLJ_RLC_2024_122.pdf#:~:text=Given%20the%20categorical%20representation%2C%20a,%CE%B1)). This Dirichlet prior captures **epistemic uncertainty** in the outcome: the agent’s belief over possible return distributions is represented by Dirichlet parameters that update with experience. Such approaches yield a distribution over outcomes (returns) instead of a single expected value, enabling risk-sensitive or uncertainty-aware decisions. The BCQL authors note that a Dirichlet over return probabilities is a _natural choice_ to represent uncertainty in the return distribution ([](https://rlj.cs.umass.edu/2024/papers/RLJ_RLC_2024_122.pdf#:~:text=Given%20the%20categorical%20representation%2C%20a,%CE%B1)), and they derive closed-form updates for posterior parameters. This provides strong **theoretical justification** for Dirichlet outcome modeling in value learning, and their experiments demonstrate improved exploration via value of perfect information estimates derived from the Dirichlet uncertainty ([](https://rlj.cs.umass.edu/2024/papers/RLJ_RLC_2024_122.pdf#:~:text=Given%20the%20categorical%20representation%2C%20a,%CE%B1)) ([](https://rlj.cs.umass.edu/2024/papers/RLJ_RLC_2024_122.pdf#:~:text=3,is%20given%20by%20PMm%3D1%20PM)).

**Evidential Neural Networks:** In supervised settings, _evidential deep learning_ uses Dirichlet distributions to quantify uncertainty. Instead of outputting a single prediction or fixed probabilities, a network predicts Dirichlet parameters, treating the resulting distribution as a **belief** over possible outcomes ([Evidential Deep Learning to Quantify Classification Uncertainty](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7580-evidential-deep-learning-to-quantify-classification-uncertainty#:~:text=Uncertainty%20papers,the%20function%20that%20collects)). This yields a measure of both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty (via the Dirichlet’s concentration). While primarily applied to classification, the same idea has been explored in RL to predict uncertain outcomes. For instance, _evidential deep Q-networks_ or _evidential actor-critic_ models output Dirichlet distributions over discrete outcome classes (like win/draw/loss or discrete return bins) to represent uncertainty in the value prediction. This approach allows the agent to know _how confident_ or uncertain its value estimate is, and adjust its policy accordingly. (One example is **Deep Evidential Reinforcement Learning**, which integrates a Dirichlet-based uncertainty model into an actor-critic framework for recommender systems ([[PDF] DEEP EVIDENTIAL REINFORCEMENT LEARNING FOR DYNAMIC ...](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=eoUsOflG7QD#:~:text=,explore%20the%20item%20space)), though similar ideas could be applied in game-playing RL.)

**Risk-Sensitive and Multi-Outcome Planning:** _Distributional Monte Carlo Tree Search (DMCTS)_ methods explicitly maintain a distribution over outcomes at each node of the search tree. Hayes et al. (2021) introduce a DMCTS that learns a **posterior distribution over the utility (return)** of different outcomes from a state, rather than just an average ([[2102.00966] Risk Aware and Multi-Objective Decision Making with Distributional Monte Carlo Tree Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00966#:~:text=potential%20range%20of%20adverse%20or,expected%20utility%20of%20the%20returns)). This is useful in **risk-aware decision-making** – for example, an action might have a high expected reward but also a small probability of a catastrophic outcome. By modeling the full distribution (e.g. a discrete distribution or samples of returns), the agent can make decisions that account for variance or tail-risk, not just the mean. Hayes et al. show that using the return distribution to guide decisions produces better policies in risk-sensitive and multi-objective settings ([[2102.00966] Risk Aware and Multi-Objective Decision Making with Distributional Monte Carlo Tree Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00966#:~:text=potential%20range%20of%20adverse%20or,expected%20utility%20of%20the%20returns)). In their framework, each node’s value is a _belief distribution_ updated via Bayesian inference as outcomes are observed, effectively a Dirichlet-like update if returns are binned into categories.

**Bayesian Planning and Dirichlet Priors:** Several works explicitly unify Bayesian uncertainty modeling with planning in _AlphaZero-like search_. **Dirichlet-NormalGamma MCTS (DNG-MCTS)** is an earlier approach that represents uncertainty over returns in each tree node with a conjugate Bayesian model ([Bayesian Mixture Modelling and Inference based Thompson Sampling in Monte-Carlo Tree Search](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/hash/846c260d715e5b854ffad5f70a516c88-Abstract.html#:~:text=inference%20based%20Thompson%20sampling%20approach,for%20general%20Markov%20decision%20processes)). It uses a Dirichlet-NormalGamma prior, which can be thought of as a Dirichlet prior over discrete outcome probabilities combined with a Normal/Gamma for reward magnitude. At each decision node, _Thompson sampling_ is used to select actions: the algorithm samples a value for each action from the posterior outcome distribution and then picks the action with the highest sampled value ([Bayesian Mixture Modelling and Inference based Thompson Sampling in Monte-Carlo Tree Search](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/hash/846c260d715e5b854ffad5f70a516c88-Abstract.html#:~:text=inference%20based%20Thompson%20sampling%20approach,for%20general%20Markov%20decision%20processes)). This effectively uses the **outcome distribution (Dirichlet-NormalGamma)** to drive the policy. Bai et al. (2013) show this Bayesian MCTS achieved state-of-the-art performance vs. UCT in planning benchmarks ([Bayesian Mixture Modelling and Inference based Thompson Sampling in Monte-Carlo Tree Search](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/hash/846c260d715e5b854ffad5f70a516c88-Abstract.html#:~:text=inference%20based%20Thompson%20sampling%20approach,for%20general%20Markov%20decision%20processes)), thanks to better exploration of uncertain but promising actions. More recently, _Greshler et al. (2023)_ advocate a similar Bayesian approach for AlphaZero-style planning. They incorporate **neural network uncertainty estimates** into MCTS, performing posterior sampling at each node (or an analog of Bayes-UCB) to select actions ([A Bayesian Approach to Online Planning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.02103#:~:text=as%20concrete%20instances%20of%20the,use%20of%20uncertainty%20estimates%20about)) ([A Bayesian Approach to Online Planning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.02103#:~:text=learning%20of%20value%20functions%20into,In%20the%20setting%20we%20investigate)). The key idea is that if the value network can provide a confidence or variance for its predictions (e.g. via an ensemble or Bayesian last layer), the search can **prioritize actions with high uncertainty** (since they might lead to high payoffs upon further exploration). They provide theoretical Bayesian regret bounds and show empirically on procedurally generated game levels that with **accurate uncertainty estimates**, Bayesian MCTS _significantly outperforms_ standard MCTS ([A Bayesian Approach to Online Planning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.02103#:~:text=and%20therefore%20we%20expect%20some,potential%20of%20the%20Bayesian%20paradigm)). However, they also note the practical challenge: existing methods for estimating a network’s epistemic uncertainty (like ensembles or dropout) were not accurate enough to consistently improve performance ([A Bayesian Approach to Online Planning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.02103#:~:text=and%20therefore%20we%20expect%20some,potential%20of%20the%20Bayesian%20paradigm)), pointing to the need for better uncertainty-estimation techniques in deep RL. Nonetheless, these works demonstrate a growing trend of **unifying Dirichlet-like uncertainty modeling with the search/planning process** in an AlphaZero framework.

# Boltzmann/Free-Energy Policy Distributions in RL

**Maximum Entropy (Boltzmann) RL:** In standard reinforcement learning, _Boltzmann (softmax) policies_ have long been used for exploration – e.g. selecting actions with probability proportional to $\exp(Q(s,a)/T)$ instead of greedily taking the max-Q action. Modern **maximum entropy RL** formalizes this idea: rather than optimizing only expected reward, the agent maximizes reward _plus_ an entropy bonus. This yields policies of the form $\pi(a|s) \propto \exp\{Q^{\text{soft}}(s,a)/\alpha\}$, a Boltzmann distribution over actions. **Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)** is a prime example: it trains a policy to maximize expected return _and_ policy entropy, resulting in a stochastic policy that naturally trades off exploration and exploitation. Theoretical work (e.g. Nachum et al. 2017’s Path Consistency Learning) shows that assuming the policy is Boltzmann-distributed can simplify RL algorithms and improve convergence ([](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v162/zhao22h/zhao22h.pdf#:~:text=The%20concept%20of%20consistency%20is,policy%20is%20in%20Boltzmann%20distribution)). In practice, SAC and related methods show strong empirical results on continuous control tasks due to the stability given by entropy regularization. The _Distributional Soft Actor-Critic (DSAC)_ further combines this with outcome distributions: it learns a **distributional critic** (capturing return randomness) while using a Boltzmann policy for the actor. Ma et al. (2020) report that **integrating SAC with a distributional perspective** yields better performance than either alone ([[2004.14547] DSAC: Distributional Soft Actor Critic for Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14547#:~:text=called%20Distributional%20Soft%20Actor%20Critic,related%20metrics)). DSAC’s policy still follows a Boltzmann form (due to the entropy term), but the critic’s distributional outputs allow optimizing risk-sensitive objectives (like variance or CVaR) beyond just the mean ([[2004.14547] DSAC: Distributional Soft Actor Critic for Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14547#:~:text=Seamlessly%20integrating%20SAC%20,the%20agent%20performs%20better%20for)). This highlights that _Boltzmann policies and uncertainty modeling are compatible and even complementary_ in RL – the entropy encourages broad exploration, while the distributional critic provides nuanced feedback about the range of outcomes.

**Boltzmann Policies in Planning:** AlphaZero’s MCTS selection was largely based on Upper Confidence Bound (UCT) rules, but there’s research injecting Boltzmann/entropy principles directly into tree search. **Maximum Entropy Tree Search (MENTS)** (2019) modifies MCTS to use a _Boltzmann action selection_ at each node, rather than the deterministic UCB formula. Essentially, the probability of selecting a child node during simulation is proportional to $\exp(Q / T)$ (blending in the learned policy prior as well). This **encourages broader exploration** of the search space, guided by a “soft” evaluation of returns ([Monte Carlo Tree Search with Boltzmann Exploration | OpenReview](<https://openreview.net/forum?id=NG4DaApavi&referrer=%5Bthe%20profile%20of%20Bruno%20Lacerda%5D(%2Fprofile%3Fid%3D~Bruno_Lacerda1)#:~:text=However%2C%20UCT%20can%20be%20slow,to%20be%20sampled%20faster%20by>)). However, a known issue is that optimizing for the maximum-entropy objective (which values exploratory behavior) can diverge from optimizing the true objective (win/loss outcomes). Painter et al. (2023) discuss that an action which maximizes expected return is not always the one that maximizes entropy-augmented return ([Monte Carlo Tree Search with Boltzmann Exploration | OpenReview](<https://openreview.net/forum?id=NG4DaApavi&referrer=%5Bthe%20profile%20of%20Bruno%20Lacerda%5D(%2Fprofile%3Fid%3D~Bruno_Lacerda1)#:~:text=maximum%20entropy%20principle%20into%20an,to%20be%20sampled%20faster%20by>)). They propose improved algorithms **Boltzmann Tree Search (BTS)** and **Decaying Entropy Tree Search (DENTS)** to address this ([Monte Carlo Tree Search with Boltzmann Exploration | OpenReview](<https://openreview.net/forum?id=NG4DaApavi&referrer=%5Bthe%20profile%20of%20Bruno%20Lacerda%5D(%2Fprofile%3Fid%3D~Bruno_Lacerda1)#:~:text=highlight%20a%20major%20limitation%20of,including%20the%20game%20of%20Go>)). BTS/DENTS essentially anneal or adjust the entropy bonus over time so that the final policy focuses on the true objective while still gaining the early exploration benefits of Boltzmann sampling. Empirically, these methods maintain high performance on planning benchmarks (including achieving strong play in Go) while exploring more efficiently than UCT ([Monte Carlo Tree Search with Boltzmann Exploration | OpenReview](<https://openreview.net/forum?id=NG4DaApavi&referrer=%5Bthe%20profile%20of%20Bruno%20Lacerda%5D(%2Fprofile%3Fid%3D~Bruno_Lacerda1)#:~:text=benefits%20of%20Boltzmann%20policies%2C%20such,including%20the%20game%20of%20Go>)). The **key insight** is that _Boltzmann policies can be leveraged within MCTS_ to improve exploration, but they must be carefully integrated to not bias the final policy. These studies provide a strong **theoretical justification** (grounded in the maximum entropy principle) and demonstrate through ablations that their modified MCTS can converge to optimal play more reliably in certain settings, compared to naive UCT or purely deterministic search.

**Free-Energy Principle & Active Inference:** A more principled way to combine uncertainty and reward in policy selection is via the _free-energy minimization_ framework (inspired by neuroscience). The **expected free energy (EFE)** of an action can be defined as a combination of expected “energy” (negative reward, or cost) and an information gain term (uncertainty reduction). Agents that **minimize free energy** will seek rewarding states _while also reducing uncertainty_ about the world. Recent work applies this idea to RL planning. Dao & Peter (2023) introduce an MCTS variant that **blends expected reward with an information-gain bonus** at each decision ([](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.13083?#:~:text=incor%02porate%20free%20energy%20minimization%20by,to%20optimize%20action%20proposals%20at)). In their approach, the agent maintains an internal model (with an ensemble of dynamics to quantify epistemic uncertainty) and evaluates actions by a _free-energy criterion_: $\text{score}(a) = \mathbb{E}[{\text{reward}}|a] - \lambda\, \mathbb{H}[\text{belief after }a]$ (where the second term measures the entropy of the agent’s belief if that action is taken, i.e. expected info gain). They implement this with a **Cross-Entropy Method (CEM)**: maintaining a distribution (e.g. a Gaussian) over promising action sequences, iteratively updating it to maximize the free-energy objective ([](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.13083?#:~:text=incor%02porate%20free%20energy%20minimization%20by,to%20optimize%20action%20proposals%20at)) ([](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.13083?#:~:text=match%20at%20L66%20incorporating%20free,demands%20of%20planning%20in%20continuous)). This planner, essentially _MCTS guided by active inference_, is able to handle continuous action spaces and focus search on information-rich, high-reward trajectories. The authors show improved exploration in high-dimensional tasks, as the agent doesn’t purely exploit the learned value function but also seeks out observations that will reduce model uncertainty ([](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.13083?#:~:text=expected%20free%20energy%20criterion%20and,Section%202%2C%20we%20discuss%20related)). In summary, **free-energy-based policies** generalize Boltzmann policies: rather than adding a constant entropy bonus, they add a principled exploration term derived from Bayesian surprise. This yields a **stochastic policy** that is “optimal” under a combined criterion of reward + knowledge gain, which can be seen as a form of **Boltzmann policy where the Q-value is augmented** by an uncertainty bonus. Such approaches come with strong theoretical motivations (grounded in variational inference) and are beginning to show empirical promise in model-based RL and planning contexts ([](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.13083?#:~:text=Tschantz%20et%20al,for%20policy%20optimization%2C%20achieving)) ([](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.13083?#:~:text=Despite%20these%20advances%2C%20the%20integration,implementations%20adopt%20MCTS%20as%20a)).

# Unified Approaches in AlphaZero-like Frameworks

Bringing these ideas together, we see a clear trend: **AlphaZero-style systems are being enhanced by modeling outcome uncertainty (Dirichlet-like distributions) and by using principled stochastic policies (Boltzmann or free-energy-based).** A unifying theme is to treat the **neural network’s predictions not as fixed values, but as probabilistic estimates**, and to use those estimates in the search and policy update. Some notable unified approaches include:

- **Bayesian AlphaZero Variants:** As discussed, Greshler et al.’s Bayesian Tree Search integrates a neural network’s value _and uncertainty_ into MCTS ([A Bayesian Approach to Online Planning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.02103#:~:text=learning%20of%20value%20functions%20into,In%20the%20setting%20we%20investigate)). They explicitly sample from the network’s predictive distribution (or use Bayesian confidence bounds) when expanding nodes. This means the tree’s **value estimates are random variables**, and the policy at the root is derived via _Thompson sampling_ – effectively a **Boltzmann-like exploration** but derived from a Bayesian posterior. The theoretical regret bound they prove shows that if the prior (network) is confident (low entropy Dirichlet, in a discrete case) and correct, the algorithm quickly focuses on the optimal action ([A Bayesian Approach to Online Planning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.02103#:~:text=search%20problem%2C%20and%20a%20corresponding,implementation%20of%20Thomp%02son%20sampling%20tree)) ([A Bayesian Approach to Online Planning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.02103#:~:text=is%20the%20first%20regret%20analysis,our%20formula%02tion%20establishes%20them)). Empirically, even when using approximate uncertainty (via an ensemble), they achieved better performance on unseen test levels than standard AlphaZero, demonstrating the practical benefit of coupling uncertainty with policy selection ([A Bayesian Approach to Online Planning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.02103#:~:text=and%20therefore%20we%20expect%20some,potential%20of%20the%20Bayesian%20paradigm)).

- **Distributional MCTS with Thompson Sampling:** Dam et al. (2023) take a _distributional RL_ view in MCTS, modeling each **Q-node as a categorical distribution** (with support over possible returns) ([](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=HRbjVO1dKW#:~:text=In%20this%20paper%2C%20we%20bring,Categorical%20Thompson%20Sampling%20for%20MCTS)). They propose **Categorical Thompson Sampling (CTS)** for MCTS: at each decision, sample a value for each action from its Q-distribution and pick the best. This unifies uncertainty and policy in a straightforward way – high-variance (uncertain) options will sometimes be sampled as high values, prompting exploration. Their algorithms showed improved robustness in stochastic environments ([](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=HRbjVO1dKW#:~:text=randomness,asymptotic)) ([](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=HRbjVO1dKW#:~:text=3%20Distributional%20Thompson%20Sampling%20in,value%20node%20as%20a%20categorical)). Essentially, the **Dirichlet/categorical distributions over outcomes drive a Thompson-sampling policy**, which is a Bayesian analogue of a Boltzmann policy. Instead of weighting actions by $\exp(Q)$, they probabilistically weight by the chance _each action is optimal given current uncertainty_. This method has strong theoretical backing (they provide convergence proofs under certain assumptions) and exhibited favorable results in tasks where outcome variance is significant.

- **AlphaZero with Outcome Distributions:** Some researchers have suggested replacing AlphaZero’s single scalar value head with a **distributional outcome head**. For example, in games like chess which have win/draw/loss outcomes, one can train the network to output a Dirichlet or categorical distribution $(P_{\text{win}}, P_{\text{draw}}, P_{\text{loss}})$ instead of a single expected value. This would naturally provide a measure of uncertainty (e.g. a position might have 0.4 win, 0.2 draw, 0.4 loss – indicating high uncertainty in outcome). While the original AlphaZero instead “estimates and optimizes the _expected_ outcome” ([](https://www.davidsilver.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/alphazero.pdf#:~:text=outcomes,This%20fact%20was)) (treating draws as 0 and wins as 1, effectively), a distributional approach could be more informative. Open-source experimentation in this direction can be found in some AlphaZero re-implementations or research threads. For instance, one could train with a cross-entropy loss against the true outcome distribution (one-hot for win/loss in terminal states, or perhaps a Dirichlet prior updated over self-play games for non-terminals). This has not (yet) become mainstream, but the idea aligns with **evidential value networks** – the network would output Dirichlet parameters representing its belief about the probability of each outcome. Such a network could express low confidence (by outputting a near-uniform Dirichlet) or high confidence (sharp distribution) in its prediction, which in turn could modulate tree search (e.g. treat uncertain evaluations as needing deeper exploration).

- **AlphaZero’s Built-in Stochasticity:** It’s worth noting that _vanilla AlphaZero already incorporated elements of both Dirichlet and Boltzmann distributions_, albeit in a simpler form. **Dirichlet noise** is added to the policy prior at the root of the search tree during self-play to encourage exploration ([](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v162/zhao22h/zhao22h.pdf#:~:text=While%20doing%20self,an%20exponential%20distribution%20with%20a)). This noise can be seen as a pseudo-Dirichlet outcome distribution over moves – essentially assuming initially that all moves have some uncertainty in their value, which forces the search to sample a variety of moves in the opening. Additionally, AlphaZero selects moves in self-play via a **Boltzmann distribution over visit counts**: for the first few moves of each game, actions are sampled proportionally to $N^{1/\tau}$ (visit counts to a power, with $\tau$ a temperature) rather than picking the max count ([](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v162/zhao22h/zhao22h.pdf#:~:text=While%20doing%20self,an%20exponential%20distribution%20with%20a)). This is a form of Boltzmann policy derived from the MCTS statistics. The combination of Dirichlet prior noise and softmax action selection was crucial to AlphaZero’s ability to explore and avoid getting stuck in suboptimal play early in training ([](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v162/zhao22h/zhao22h.pdf#:~:text=While%20doing%20self,an%20exponential%20distribution%20with%20a)). These design choices are **supported by empirical ablations** in the AlphaZero paper and subsequent implementations: turning off Dirichlet noise or using greedy action selection too early tends to reduce playing strength, as the policy may prematurely converge. Thus, even without an explicit “Dirichlet outcome head,” AlphaZero demonstrates the _practical value_ of marrying Dirichlet-based uncertainty (for exploration) with Boltzmann-style stochastic policies.

In summary, research on AlphaZero-like frameworks is increasingly **unifying uncertainty-aware outcome prediction with policy selection**. Dirichlet and related distributions provide a principled way to represent what the agent doesn’t know about the outcome, and Boltzmann/free-energy policies provide a principled way to explore according to that uncertainty. From **Bayesian MCTS algorithms** that sample value networks to guide search ([Bayesian Mixture Modelling and Inference based Thompson Sampling in Monte-Carlo Tree Search](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/hash/846c260d715e5b854ffad5f70a516c88-Abstract.html#:~:text=inference%20based%20Thompson%20sampling%20approach,for%20general%20Markov%20decision%20processes)) ([A Bayesian Approach to Online Planning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.02103#:~:text=learning%20of%20value%20functions%20into,In%20the%20setting%20we%20investigate)), to **entropy-regularized planners** that blend exploration into the objective ([Monte Carlo Tree Search with Boltzmann Exploration | OpenReview](<https://openreview.net/forum?id=NG4DaApavi&referrer=%5Bthe%20profile%20of%20Bruno%20Lacerda%5D(%2Fprofile%3Fid%3D~Bruno_Lacerda1)#:~:text=However%2C%20UCT%20can%20be%20slow,to%20be%20sampled%20faster%20by>)) ([Monte Carlo Tree Search with Boltzmann Exploration | OpenReview](<https://openreview.net/forum?id=NG4DaApavi&referrer=%5Bthe%20profile%20of%20Bruno%20Lacerda%5D(%2Fprofile%3Fid%3D~Bruno_Lacerda1)#:~:text=highlight%20a%20major%20limitation%20of,including%20the%20game%20of%20Go>)), and _hybrid approaches_ that do both, the literature shows strong theoretical foundations (Bayesian decision theory, PAC-Bayes bounds, regret analyses, etc.) and growing empirical evidence (improvements in games, continuous control, and procedurally generated tasks). These methods indicate that agents can achieve higher sample-efficiency and robustness by **maintaining a richer belief over outcomes (using Dirichlet or similar distributions)** and **using that belief to randomize or bias policy selection (in a Boltzmann-like manner)**. As techniques for uncertainty estimation in deep networks improve, we can expect AlphaZero-style algorithms augmented with these ideas to become even more powerful.

Each of these illustrates a piece of the puzzle, and together they chart a path toward **AlphaZero-like algorithms that reason about uncertainty (Dirichlet-like distributions) and make decisions in a probabilistically optimal way (Boltzmann or free-energy policies)**. The consensus from these works is that such integrations can lead to more robust and efficient learning, provided the uncertainty estimates are reliable. The field is moving fast, and open-source implementations are beginning to incorporate these advances, pointing to practical systems that leverage both Dirichlet noise and Boltzmann rationality as first-class citizens in reinforcement learning.
